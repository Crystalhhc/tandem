Tandem is a visual editor for building the _view_ layer of your web application. This means that you're able to create most of your HTML & CSS visually.

Functionality is added in the form of _controllers_ which can be attached to any component. This is similar in principle to a view / controller relationship in MVC. Tandem components are agnostic to the code attached to them, so you can re-use your views across different languages & frameworks.
