Tandem is a web component builder that's designed to work with many different languages & frameworks (currently works with React apps, more support is planned after [Alpha](https://github.com/tandemcode/tandem/projects/10)). The tooling is inspired by Sketch, Figma, & VSCode, and are based on web standards.

### Features

- Can be used with your existing codebase (currently only React). 
- Unopinionated, so you can adapt Tandem to fit your needs.
- UI files can be organized with the code they're associated with. 
- Handwritten HTML & CSS can be mixed with Tandem UIs (this is helpful if you need to integrate complex code).
