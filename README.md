Tandem is a visual editor for building simple web components. It can cover _most_ of your HTML & CSS development, and is designed to be compatible with most web-based languages, and frameworks. It currently works with React.

### Features

Here are just a few highlights of what Tandem can do:

#### Create HTML & CSS visually

Tandem covers most of your web UI creation, so you can say goodbye to writing HTML & CSS by hand for the most part (except for more complex cases).

#### Compiles to code

Compile UI files to your language or framework of choice. You can even compile to _multiple_ targets if you want to. Want to target PHP (coming soon) _and_ React code? You can do that.

#### Immediate Feedback

No need to wait around for your code to compile. Tandem provides immediate feedback of your HTML & CSS, so you can cut down the amount of time it takes to build your web app.

More tooling & optimizations are in the pipeline to make Tandem feel like pen & paper

#### Safety First

UI files use CSS but without the "cascading" part of it, so you don't have to worry about styles overridding each other. If your using a strongly typed language like TypeScript, Tandem provides utilities around generating typed definition files for design files.

#### Organizes like code

Tandem's design was inspired by existing IDEs. Transparent, and unopinionated about how you work or organize your application.

#### Translate designs faster

Tandem makes it easier to translate design files from Sketch & Figma. Just copy & paste:
