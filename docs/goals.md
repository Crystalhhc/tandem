The ideas behind Tandem are continuing to evolve based on real-world usage, so the guiding principles in this doc _may_ change in the future. For now, the ideas here guide feature development.

#### Goals

- To be interoperable with all web-based languages.
- To be interoperable with existing code.
- Provide better tooling for authoring HTML, CSS, and simple behavior.

#### Non-goals

- Turring completeness. Tandem's functionality will be limited to tooling where it makes sense: basic HTML, CSS, and _simple_ behavior (slots & components). All other functionality will have to be hand coded.
- Sketch-like user experience. Tandem will only provide functionality & tooling that is compatible with how the web works.
- Runtimes or any other non-native functionality. Tandem files will always be compilable down to static HTML & CSS.
- Make web development easier. Easiness _may_ be a side effect, but features are generally considered if they provide a _better_ way of doing something.
