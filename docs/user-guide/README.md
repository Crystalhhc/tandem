## Read me first!

This doc is aimed to take you step-by-step through developing your _first_ application with Tandem. Example code and videos are also provided with each phase to help you along the way.

There are many nuances, patterns, and terminology used in the app, so I wouldn't recomend skipping through any section. Cliff notes are available for each section for anyone in a rush. I also added some personal thoughts, workflows, and philosophies into the user guide here that may seem obvious to experienced developers, or people may disagree with, but a minor intent in spelling some of the higher level ideas is to show how Tandem _aims_ to be a wholesome tool.

## What is Tandem and why should I use it?

The current way of building web apps involves hand writing HTML & CSS, then switching to a browser (like Chrome, or Firefox) to test your code. The process is rather cumbersome, requiring lots of time writing the code (where you have to picture the output in your head), waiting for it to build, then previewing your creation only to realize that the UI you just wrote was incorrect and would require you to make tweaks and wait another 20 seconds for your app to build before you can see it again.

> Personally I find the _speed_ of writing code to be one of the most important attributes of building a product, far above writing tests, or type safety. Hardly anything that I write is "correct", and if I get to write code _faster_, then I can more quickly let my creations out in the real world into the chaos that will always drives them to evolve to what they need to be.

Tandem was developed to be a faster & more intuitive tool around creating web components. It's intended to be simple, and only provides you with visual tooling for authoring web applications _where it makes sense_. That goes for the _visual_ creation of web apps -- mainly HTML & CSS. Tandem is designed to handle most HTML & CSS cases, so you'll rarely be bogged down by writing visual code by hand (there are some complex cases that Tandem can't handle, and Tandem doesn't aim to cover every case since that would add _unnecessary_ complexity to the user experience. Sometimes code is the best medium). Tandem also provides a nice buffer between your _actual_ code since there isn't much logic involved, and that means you're able to build your UIs in Tandem _first_, then wire them up with code later on. In other words:

1. You don't need to worry or even think about what language or framework you're picking before you start using Tandem.
2. You can compile Tandem UIs to multiple language and framework targets.
3. Your Tandem UIs are more resilient to underlying to code changes.

Basically, Tandem is aimed to be a _better_, and _safer_ way around building web components that allows you to focus on the more complicated parts of your app: code & product.

> Why should you trust that Tandem works? Well, you probably shouldn't _completely_. Like any tool, Tandem isn't able to solve every visual development problem you have (Tandem for example hasn't been tested outside of web apps, and websites [game development, ]), nor will Tandem be compatible with _every_ framework, or language. I think it's prudent to look at how this app may be compatible with your product & team, and to involve safety hatches that enable you to migrate away from Tandem if it isn't a good fit. A lot of these safety hatches are baked in (decoupling UI from your code, and migration tools in the roadmap), but it'd be disengenous for me to request that you "just trust" the app when _I myself_ have a hard to believing in perfect solutions. Every technical consideration needs a plan B. I can tell you though that Tandem is _actively_ used in building products (including itself), so a lot of its features & patterns are being _discovered_ over time instead of speculated.

#### TL;DR

Tandem allows you to visually create web components, and integrates with your existing codebase. Features for building HTML & CSS are actively being discovered based on real world usage (via product development, and that Tandem is used to build itself).

## Building your first app

In this section we'll build a simple todo app.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have basic knowledge of HTML & CSS in order to get started, and a little coding experience doesn't hurt either if you're looking to add behavior to your UIs. Don't worry about needing to know how to code _before_ using Tandem though.

Assuming that you have some HTML & CSS chops, you can go ahead and download the current _preview_ version of Tandem here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bwvotfx13u8rsvw/latest.zip?dl=0.

We'll be using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](TODO) in this tutorial, so be sure to have those installed too.

## Starting a project

Open Tandem & click "create a project". Tandem will prompt you to pick a directory where you want your project to live. If you have a projects folder directory, navigate over to that and create a new sub directory called `chatroom` (that's what we're going to work). Select that new directory and click `Open`.

![create new project](assets/create-new-project.gif)

With the selected directory, Tandem will create a new group of files which make up the structure of a basic project. They are:

#### app.tdproject

The `*.tdproject` file contains your Tandem project configuration. You can checkout more information about it [here](./app-config.md). Though, the default
settings will suffice for our chatroom app.

#### src/

The `src` directory contains all of your source files including your component files (`*.pc`), and JavaScript files. Anything that gets built basically.

#### src/main.pc

The `main.pc` is your main component file (`pc` stands for paperclip). You're welcome to organize components into _multiple_ `*.pc` files in your `src/` directory if you want. More on that later.

### Understanding the editor at a high level

We'll jump into explaining the UI real quick. I won't go into too much detail here since more UI explainations will come later on when we start building things. Go ahead and select the main `Application` frame you see in the canvas.

![select app](assets/select-app.gif)

Here's a basic map of the editor:

![basic explaination](assets/basic-ui-explaination.png)

#### Project files

Starting in the lower left section, the `Files` pane contains _all_ of your project files including your JavaScript, component files, images, and other assets.

#### Layers

The `Layers` pane contains all open component files `*.pc` and gives you a view of your component structure. If you're familiar with Chrome's or Firefox's HTML inspector feature, Layers is kind of like that.

#### Tools

Tools provide you with a way to insert new `elements`, `text`, and `component instances` into your canvas.

### Creating HTML & CSS

[VIDEO]

We'll start off creating the app's HTML & CSS. We won't spend too much time making the app look pretty because I want to get around to showing the basics. Later on I'll show you how to import existing design files from Sketch and Figma to automatically create some of the UI for you. For now though, we'll keep things simple. ðŸ™‚

Here's what we're going to build:
